    "The job market is often filled with ups and downs, and those searching for a job would want to understand where the job market is; and how to predict the upcoming job market during their application period. As a student appling to internships, I would like to understand how the job market FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS IN THE UNITED STATES changes over time, and what salary and satisfaction rate I can expect while going into the job market in computer science.\n",
